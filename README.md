SlackBuilds for the Studioware Project

About The Studioware Project
----------------------------

Studioware is a project aimed at providing SlackBuild scripts for the best open source audio, video and photo editing software available for Slackware Linux. It includes libraries and other dependencies with a comprehensive dependency list for each package so you will know exactly what you need to install. Although Studioware is quite a small project, the maintainers are Slackware users of many years experience. The wiki is being built up steadily and is the main source of the project's [documentation](http://docs.slackware.com/studioware:start) and is hosted by the Slackware Documentation Project. See the [Quick Start](http://docs.slackware.com/studioware:quick_start) guide to get started.
