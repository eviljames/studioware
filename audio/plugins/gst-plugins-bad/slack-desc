# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

gst-plugins-bad:
gst-plugins-bad: GStreamer Bad Plug-ins is a set of plug-ins that aren't up to par
gst-plugins-bad: compared to the rest. They might be close to being good quality, but
gst-plugins-bad: they're missing something - be it a good code review, some
gst-plugins-bad: documentation, a set of tests, a real live maintainer, or some actual
gst-plugins-bad: wide use.
