# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

lv2: lv2 ( plugin system for audio systems )
lv2:
lv2: LV2 is a portable plugin standard for audio systems, similar in scope
lv2: to LADSPA, VST, AU, and others. It defines a C API for code and
lv2: a format for data files which collectively describe a plugin. LV2
lv2: consists of a simple core (roughly equivalent in power to LADSPA)
lv2: which can be extended to support more advanced functionality. This 
lv2: allows the interface to be "grown" to accommodate the needs of real
lv2: software as they arise.
