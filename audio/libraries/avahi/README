avahi (Zero-configuration networking (zeroconf) implementation)

Avahi is a free Zero-configuration networking (zeroconf)
implementation, including a system for multicast DNS/DNS-SD
service discovery. It allows programs to publish and
discover services and hosts running on a local network with
no specific configuration. For example you can plug into a
network and instantly find printers to print to, files to
look at and people to talk to. It is licensed under the GNU
