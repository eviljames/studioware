# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

mxml:
mxml: Mini-XML is a small XML library that you can use to read and write
mxml: XML and XML-like data files in your application without requiring
mxml: large non-standard libraries. Mini-XML only requires an ANSI C
mxml: compatible compiler (GCC works, as do most vendors' ANSI C compilers)
mxml: and a 'make' program.
