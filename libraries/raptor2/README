raptor2 ( Raptor RDF Syntax Library ) 

Raptor is a free software / Open Source C library that provides a set of parsers and serializers that generate Resource Description Framework (RDF) triples by parsing syntaxes or serialize the triples into a syntax. The supported parsing syntaxes are RDF/XML, N-Quads, N-Triples, TRiG, Turtle, RSS tag soup including all versions of RSS, Atom 1.0 and 0.3, GRDDL and microformats for HTML, XHTML and XML and RDFa. The serializing syntaxes are RDF/XML (regular, and abbreviated), Atom 1.0, GraphViz, JSON, N-Quads, N-Triples, RSS 1.0 and XMP.

Raptor was designed to work closely with the Redland RDF library (RDF Parser Toolkit for Redland) but is entirely separate. It is a portable library that works across many POSIX systems (Unix, GNU/Linux, BSDs, OSX, cygwin, win32).
